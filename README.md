# employee-tracker
Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 12. A command-line application to manage a company's employee database, built using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## About This Repository
This repository contains the working files for the Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 11. <br>
This is a Node.js application meant to run directly in the command line. The user interacts with the application by answering a series of queries.

## Installation
This application requires the user to have MySQL software installed on their computer to run. Install the node modules by running the usual commands `npm install` for the first only. Then, the user should initialize MySQL and create the databases using the DB and Schema files provided `source ~/.../db/db.sql` and `source ~/.../db/schema.sql`. <br>
For demonstration purposes, a few data entries were created based on character names from the TV series The Office. To populate the database using these, run `source ~/.../db/seeds.sql`.

## Usage
To start the application, run `npm start` and follow the prompts on the screen. <br>
